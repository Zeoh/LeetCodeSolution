**Medium**

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-subsequence/)

Given a string _s_, find the longest palindromic subsequence's length in _s_. You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.

##### Example 1:
```
Input: "bbbab"
Output: 4

One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bbbb".
```

##### Example 2:
```
Input: "cbbd"
Output: 2
