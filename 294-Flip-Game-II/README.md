**Medium**

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/flip-game-ii/)

You are playing the following Flip Game with your friend: Given a string that contains only these two characters: `+` and `-`, you and your friend take turns to flip two __consecutive__ `"++"` into `"--"`. The game ends when a person can no longer make a move and therefore the other person will be the winner.

Write a function to determine if the starting player can guarantee a win.

##### Example:
```
Input: s = "++++"
Output: true 
Explanation: The starting player can guarantee a win by flipping the middle "++" to become "+--+".
```

##### Follow up:
Derive your algorithm's runtime complexity.
