[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-duplicates-in-an-array/)

Given an array of integers, 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ _n_ (_n_ = size of array), some elements appear __twice__ and others appear __once__.

Find all the elements that appear __twice__ in this array.

Could you do it without extra space and in O(_n_) runtime?

##### Example:
```
Input:
[4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]

Output:
[2,3]
```
