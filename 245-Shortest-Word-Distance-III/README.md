Given a list of words and two words _word1_ and _word2_, return the shortest distance between these two words in the list.

_word1_ and _word2_ may be the same and they represent two individual words in the list.

##### Example:
Assume that words = `["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"]`.
```
Input: word1 = “makes”, word2 = “coding”
Output: 1
```
```
Input: word1 = "makes", word2 = "makes"

```

##### Note:
You may assume _word1_ and _word2_ are both in the list.
