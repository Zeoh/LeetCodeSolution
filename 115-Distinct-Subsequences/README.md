# 115. Distinct Subsequences

**Medium**

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/bag-of-tokens/)

Given a string __S__ and a string __T__, count the number of distinct subsequences of __S__ which equals __T__.

A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, `"ACE"` is a subsequence of `"ABCDE"` while `"AEC"` is not).

##### Example 1:
```
Input: S = "rabbbit", T = "rabbit"
Output: 3
Explanation:

As shown below, there are 3 ways you can generate "rabbit" from S.
(The caret symbol ^ means the chosen letters)

rabbbit

##### Example 2: 
```
Input: S = "babgbag", T = "bag"
Output: 5
