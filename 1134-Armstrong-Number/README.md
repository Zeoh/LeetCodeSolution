# 1134. Armstrong Number

**Easy**

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/armstrong-number/)

The k-digit number `N` is an Armstrong number if and only if the k-th power of each digit sums to N.

Given a positive integer N, return true if and only if it is an Armstrong number.

##### Example 1:
```
Input: [5,7,3,9,4,9,8,3,1]
Output: 8
Explanation: 
The maximum integer in the array is 9 but it is repeated. The number 8 occurs only once, so it's the answer.
```

##### Example 2:
```
Input: [9,9,8,8]
Output: -1
Explanation: 
There is no number that occurs only once.
```

##### Note:
1. `1 <= A.length <= 2000`
2. `0 <= A[i] <= 1000`
