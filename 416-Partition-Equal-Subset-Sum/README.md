**Medium**

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-equal-subset-sum/)

Given a __non-empty__ array containing __only positive integers__, find if the array can be partitioned into two subsets such that the sum of elements in both subsets is equal.

##### Note:
1. Each of the array element will not exceed 100.
2. The array size will not exceed 200.

##### Example 1:
```
Input: [1, 5, 11, 5]

Output: true

Explanation: The array can be partitioned as [1, 5, 5] and [11].
```

##### Example 2: 
```
Input: [1, 2, 3, 5]

Output: false

Explanation: The array cannot be partitioned into equal sum subsets.
```
