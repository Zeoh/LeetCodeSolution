# 244. Shortest Word Distance II

**Medium**

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-word-distance-ii/)

Design a class which receives a list of words in the constructor, and implements a method that takes two words _word1_ and _word2_ and return the shortest distance between these two words in the list. Your method will be called _repeatedly_ many times with different parameters. 

##### Example:
Assume that words = `["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"]`.
```
Input: word1 = “coding”, word2 = “practice”
Output: 3
```
```
Input: word1 = "makes", word2 = "coding"
Output: 1
```

##### Note:
You may assume that _word1_ __does not equal to__ _word2_, and _word1_ and _word2_ are both in the list.
