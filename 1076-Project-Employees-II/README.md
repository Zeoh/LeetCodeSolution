Create table If Not Exists Employee (employee_id int, name varchar(10), experience_years int)
Truncate table Project
insert into Project (project_id, employee_id) values ('1', '1')

```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| project_id  | int     |
| employee_id | int     |
+-------------+---------+
(project_id, employee_id) is the primary key of this table.
employee_id is a foreign key to Employee table.
```

Table: `Employee`
```
+------------------+---------+
| Column Name      | Type    |
+------------------+---------+
| employee_id      | int     |
| name             | varchar |
| experience_years | int     |
+------------------+---------+
employee_id is the primary key of this table.
```

Write an SQL query that reports all the __projects__ that have the most employees.

The query result format is in the following example:
```
Project table:
+-------------+-------------+
| project_id  | employee_id |
+-------------+-------------+
| 1           | 1           |
| 1           | 2           |
| 1           | 3           |
| 2           | 1           |
| 2           | 4           |
+-------------+-------------+

Employee table:
+-------------+--------+------------------+
| employee_id | name   | experience_years |
+-------------+--------+------------------+
| 1           | Khaled | 3                |
| 2           | Ali    | 2                |
| 3           | John   | 1                |
| 4           | Doe    | 2                |
+-------------+--------+------------------+

Result table:
+-------------+
| project_id  |
+-------------+
| 1           |
+-------------+
The first project has 3 employees while the second one has 2.
```
