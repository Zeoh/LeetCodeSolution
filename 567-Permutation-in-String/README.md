# 567. Permutation in String

**Medium**

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutation-in-string/)

Given two strings __s1__ and __s2__, write a function to return true if __s2__ contains the permutation of __s1__. In other words, one of the first string's permutations is the __substring__ of the second string.

##### Example 1:
```
Input: s1 = "ab" s2 = "eidbaooo"
Output: True
Explanation: s2 contains one permutation of s1 ("ba").
```

##### Example 2:
```
Input:s1= "ab" s2 = "eidboaoo"
Output: False
```

##### Note:
1. The input strings only contain lower case letters.
2. The length of both given strings is in range [1, 10,000].
