##### Example:
Assume that words = `["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"]`.
```
Input: word1 = “coding”, word2 = “practice”
Output: 3
```
```
Input: word1 = "makes", word2 = "coding"

##### Note:
You may assume that _word1_ __does not equal to__ _word2_, and _word1_ and _word2_ are both in the list.
