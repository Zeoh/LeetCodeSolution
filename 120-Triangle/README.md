# 120. Triangle

**Medium**

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/triangle/)

Given a triangle, find the minimum path sum from top to bottom. Each step you may move to adjacent numbers on the row below.

For example, given the following triangle

```
[
     [2],
    [3,4],
   [6,5,7],
  [4,1,8,3]
]
```

The minimum path sum from top to bottom is `11` (i.e., __2__ + __3__ + __5__ + __1__ = 11).

##### Note:
Bonus point if you are able to do this using only O(_n_) extra space, where n is the total number of rows in the triangle.
