**Easy**

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-three-sorted-arrays/)

Given three integer arrays `arr1`, `arr2` and `arr3` __sorted__ in __strictly increasing__ order, return a sorted array of __only__ the integers that appeared in __all__ three arrays.

##### Example 1:
```
Input: arr1 = [1,2,3,4,5], arr2 = [1,2,5,7,9], arr3 = [1,3,4,5,8]
Output: [1,5]
Explanation: Only 1 and 5 appeared in the three arrays.
```

##### Constraints:
- `1 <= arr1.length, arr2.length, arr3.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= arr1[i], arr2[i], arr3[i] <= 2000`
